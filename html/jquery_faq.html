<h1>Murders In America's National Parks</h1>
<dl>
    <dt>1969: Dennis Lloyd Martin goes missing (Great Smokey Mountains National Park)</dt>
    <dd>
        In the summer of 1969, 7-year-old Dennis was camping with his family in the Great Smoky Mountains like they do
        every year. A group of boys including Dennis decided to pull a prank on the family and try to scare them. So,
        the boys all split up to encircle the family when Dennis never showed back up. That night all the families and
        authorities went on a hunt for the boy. Unfortunately, that same night they got two inches of rain making it
        almost impossible to find Dennis. To this day there has still been no sign of the boy.

    <dt>1974: The Cowden family massacre (Rogue River National Forest)</dt>
    <dd>
        On September 1, 1974, the Cowden family—28-year-old Richard and 22-year-old Belinda Cowden, their five-year-old
        son David, five-month-old daughter Melissa, and basset hound, Droopy—disappeared in Oregon near the Rogue River
        National Forest Campground in the Siskiyou Mountains. More than a year later, on April 12, 1975, two hikers made
        a horrific discovery: the decomposing body of Richard, tied to a tree. The remains of Belinda, David, and the
        baby were found hidden in a nearby cave.

    <dt>1980: Chiricahua Ranger Disappears (Chiricahua National Monument)</dt>
    <dd>
        The last time anyone saw Paul Braxton Fugate, a ranger at Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona, was Jan. 13,
        1980, when the 41-year-old went for a hike and disappeared. Fugate, who had been working in the monument’s
        visitor center, left the building to hike a park trail and was never seen again.

    <dt>1981: The murders of Robert Mountford Jr. and Laura Susan Ramsay (Appalachian Trail)</dt>
    <dd>
        In May of 1981, Maine-based social workers Laura Susan Ramsay and Robert Mountford Jr., both 27, were hiking the
        Appalachian Trail to raise funds for a youth-focused social services agency. On May 19, the pair were murdered
        and their bodies hidden at the Wapiti Shelter in Giles, Virginia.
    </dd>
    <dt>1996: The murder of Julie Williams and Lollie Winans (Shenandoah National Park)</dt>
    <dd>
        On May 19, 1996, 24-year-old Julianne Williams and 26-year-old Lollie Winans visited Shenandoah National Park in
        Virginia with their golden retriever. After a day of hiking, Williams and Winans camped near Bridal Trail during
        a particularly busy weekend at the park. And on May 31st, when the two didn’t return home as expected, Williams’
        father reported them missing. Bridget Bohnet, Deputy Chief Ranger at Shenandoah National Park, said of the
        search: “We started doing hasty searches to cover all of those trail corridors in that general area to see if we
        could locate them. At some point during those hasty searches we did locate the dog.” On June 1st, the bodies of
        the two women were found.

    <dt>2005: The Murder of Arman Johnson</dt>
    <dd>
        Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park may be one of the premier spots in the country to view active volcanoes, but on
        April 13, 2005, it was the scene of a murder. On that date, the body of Arman Johnson was found by a park
        visitor near Kahuku Ranch, close to the park's southern boundary. Johnson, who was 44 years old at the time he
        was killed, had moved to the Big Island from Seattle, Wash. in 1984, and hosted a local radio show. Though the
        suspect and motive remain unknown, authorities said evidence indicates Johnson suffered a single gunshot wound
        to his upper back/neck. Investigators believe the murder, which remains unsolved, took place where the body was
        found.

    <dt>2006: 8 year old Samuel Boehlke vanishes (Crater Lake National Park)</dt>
    <dd>
        One of the more unusual unsolved disappearances at a national park is the case of 8-year-old Samuel Boehlke, who
        vanished on Oct. 14, 2006, while on a trip to Crater Lake National Park in Oregon with his father. A massive
        search was initiated but no trace of the boy was ever found.
    </dd>
    <dt>2008: The murder of Meredith Emerson (Appalachian Trail)</dt>
    <dd>
        On New Year’s Day 2008, 24-year-old Meredith Emerson began a hike up Blood Mountain in Georgia with her beloved
        labrador. When she met a fellow hiker with a dog of his own on the path, it is believed that Emerson and
        61-year-old Gary Michael Hilton briefly walked near or beside each other near the Appalachian Trail. Emerson
        eventually pulled ahead, but when she crossed Hilton’s path again, he pulled a knife on her and demanded her ATM
        card. This began a horrific four-day ordeal in which a captive Emerson used her martial arts training to fight
        back, demonstrating tremendous courage and intelligence. In addition to breaking her kidnapper’s hand, Emerson
        repeatedly gave him the wrong PIN number for her ATM card, causing him to leave an electronic trail behind for
        searchers looking for the missing hiker. “That’s one thing that broke my heart in this case,” said Georgia
        Bureau of Investigation agent Clay Bridges. “She was doing everything she was supposed to do to stay alive, and
        we didn’t get there in time.” On the fourth day of her captivity, Hilton killed Emerson, but released her dog.
        Hilton was arrested the following day when a citizen called in a tip that a man matching the description of the
        wanted hiker was seen cleaning a van.

    <dt>2011: The Murder of Scott Lilly (Appalachian Trail)</dt>
    <dd>
        In 2011, 30-year-old Scott A. Lilly began a trip along the Appalachian trail. A history enthusiast, Lilly was
        excited to hike from Maryland to Springer Mountain, visiting Civil War battlegrounds along the way. He set off
        on his adventure on June 15, 2011; and on Aug. 12, 2011, Lilly’s body was found by a group of hikers in George
        Washington–Jefferson National Forest. His backpack and other gear were not found at the scene. Officials
        determined that Lilly had likely been dead for 12 days before his body was found, and that he had died from
        “asphyxia by suffocation.” In 2012, US Attorney Tim Heaphy said there was no information yet that linked the
        death to other murders near the national forest. Lilly’s death was ruled a homicide, and has yet to be solved.

    <dt>2021: Killing of Gabby Petito (Bridger Teton National Forest</dt>
    <dd>
        Gabby Petito was killed while traveling on a vanlife journey across the United States with her fiancé, Brian
        Laundrie. The trip began on July 2, 2021, and was planned to last four months; however, Petito disappeared in
        late August. After Petito went missing, Laundrie raised suspicion when he drove Petito's van from Wyoming back
        to his parents' house in North Port, Florida, and refused to talk about her whereabouts. He was deemed a person
        of interest in the case, and an arrest warrant was issued on charges of making withdrawals using Petito's debit
        card. Laundrie departed his home in Florida on September 13 and was reported missing on September 17. On
        September 19, Petito's remains were found at Bridger–Teton National Forest in Wyoming. According to the autopsy,
        she was killed by manual strangulation. After a month of speculation around Laundrie's whereabouts and an
        extended search of the area around his Florida home, his skeletal remains were discovered in the Myakkahatchee
        Creek Environmental Park on October 20. On November 23, it was announced that Laundrie died due to a
        self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
